# ACME
ACME is a combinatorial approach that scales to gigabyte long sequences, and is the first to support supermaximal motifs. ACME introduces an automatic tuning mechanism that suggests the appropriate number of CPUs to utilize, in order to meet the user constraints in terms of run time, while minimizing the financial cost of cloud resources.
